## Summary of Project

- Establish context for developers on other teams
- What is the final product being handed off to the client?

## Existing Solutions (either in BP or externally)

-	Not end-to-end solutions but can we use existing pieces of other projects (e.g. auth)?

## Technical Design (write justification for all non-trivial design decisions)

-	Technology selection (list all alternatives and talk about pros and cons)
-	Frontend component design
-	Backend service architecture

## Scale

-	What scale do we expect?
-	Whatâ€™s the plan if you need 10x scale?  100x?

## Cost

- What's the estimated cost of running the solution?  You'll probably have to make a bunch of assumptions but a ballpark number is good enough. Make sure that the client understands this and is okay with the cost.

## Security/Privacy Considerations

- Are you storing personally identifiable information?
- Are you using best practices for holding passwords (salting and hashing?)
- Are you sanitizing database input?
